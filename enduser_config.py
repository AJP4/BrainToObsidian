# If True, the script will create an empty obsidian vault directory before running the script.
# If False, the script will use the leave obsidian vault files but obsidian notes with file names the same as those from the brain export will be over written.
# This is useful for testing purposes, but be careful as it will delete any existing files in the vault directory.
